## Always use semicolons

Relying on implicit insertion can cause subtle (Automatic Semicolon Insertion - ASI), hard to debug problems. Don't do it. You're better than that.

There are a couple places where missing semicolons are particularly dangerous:

```js
// example 1
a = b + c
[1].push(a)

// example 2
a = b + c
(options || {}).foo ? bar() : baz()
```

In both of these cases, the parser doesnâ€™t need to apply ASI in order to have properly formed code. In the first example, it can ignore the new line and treat the [ as applying to c, likewise in the second example, the ( can apply to c. 


## Don`t use primitive types wrapper objects for assign value to variable

There's no reason to use wrapper objects for primitive types, plus they're dangerous:

```js
var x = new Boolean(false);
if (x) {
  alert('hi');  // Shows 'hi', coz typeof x === 'object'
}
```

Don't do it!
However type casting is fine.

```js
var x = Boolean(0);
if (x) {
  alert('hi');  // This will never be alerted, coz typeof x === 'boolean'
}
```

This is very useful for casting things to number, string and boolean.


## Method and property definitions

Define instance properties at contructor, prototype properties and methods as prototype members:

```js
function Foo() {
	this.someInstanceProperty = 1;
}
Foo.prototype.somePrototypeProperty = '1';
Foo.prototype.somePrototypeMethod = function() {	
};
```
